## Game Plan

Concept: Find the Odd One Out

The game involves multiple characters loading into a top-down grid. One character will move differently to the rest of the characters e.g. they might move slightly faster or favour left more than right, the player must find and click on the odd character (there will only be ever 1 to find) to progress to the next level. Clicking the incorrect character would cause them to lose the game and start again. They are time limited per level as well. Each level they get less time to find the odd character.

Fits following theming: Pay Attention, Only One, Out of Place.
